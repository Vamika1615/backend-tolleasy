TollEasy Backend - Dummy User Credentials
==========================================

All dummy users share the same password: password123

The application automatically creates 20 random users with the following format:
- Email: firstname.lastname###@domain.com (### is a random number)
- Password: password123

Example users:
1. aarav.sharma123@gmail.com / password123
2. divya.patel456@outlook.com / password123
3. krishna.iyer789@yahoo.com / password123

Notes:
- Each user has 1-3 vehicles
- Each user has 0-2 payment methods
- Each user has a random balance between ₹200 and ₹5000
- About 90% of users have a subscription plan

You can use any of these random accounts to log in, or you can check the actual generated accounts by looking at the console output when the server starts.

For testing API endpoints directly:
1. Use the /api/token endpoint to get a JWT token:
   ```
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/token' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     -d 'username=aarav.sharma123@gmail.com&password=password123'
   ```

2. Include the token in the Authorization header for authenticated requests:
   ```
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/users/me' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
   ```
